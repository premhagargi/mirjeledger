/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, role-based access control model centered around a single "admin" role.
 * All data manipulation and read operations for the core business collections (stocks, agents, purchases, sales)
 * are exclusively reserved for authenticated users who are designated as administrators.
 * The default security posture is to deny all access, ensuring that only explicitly granted permissions are allowed.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into flat, top-level collections. A special collection, `/roles_admin`, is used
 * to manage administrative privileges. The existence of a user's UID as a document ID within this collection
 * signifies that they are an admin. All other collections (`/stocks`, `/agents`, `/purchases`, `/sales`)
 * store the primary application data.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Admin-Only Access**: The entire database is secured by a single check: `isAdmin()`. This function
 *   verifies that a user is authenticated and has a corresponding entry in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * - **No Public Access**: There is no publicly readable or writable data. All operations require an
 *   authenticated admin user.
 * - **Client-Side Role Management Disabled**: The `/roles_admin` collection is read-only from the client.
 *   This is a critical security measure to prevent any possibility of privilege escalation. Admin roles
 *   must be assigned manually through the Firebase Console.
 * - **Homogeneous Collections**: Each collection contains data with a uniform security requirement (admin-only).
 *   This design simplifies query rules (`list`) and ensures they are both secure and performant, avoiding
 *   "rules are not filters" issues.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * Authorization is not based on per-document ownership but on a global user role. The `/roles_admin`
 * collection serves as the central, authoritative source for this role. This avoids the need for `ownerId`
 * fields or `get()` calls within rules, making them fast and simple. The model is built on the principle
 * that a single admin user manages all data.
 *
 * ## Structural Segregation
 * The architecture naturally follows the structural segregation principle by design. Since all data has the same
 * high-security requirement (admin-only), there is no mixing of public and private data within any collection.
